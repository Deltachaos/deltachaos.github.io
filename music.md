Music has so many facets. It’s a political statement, trivial chatter; it can pull you into another world, make you
angry, anxious, carefree—or all of it at once.

## Vinyl

And because music says so much about a person—perhaps more than many other things—you’ll find my carefully curated
vinyl collection here.

By the way, I’m always happy to receive suggestions!
